# django-aggregate-lot-external-contents aka DALEC ü§ñ

Django Aggregate Lot External Contents (DALEC) is a generic app to aggregate contents from various
external sources. Purposes are to manage (retrieve, clean, display‚Ä¶) those contents in a
generic way independent of the source.

It's designed to be customized / extended to fit your needs.

## Concepts

Contents are categorized via :

* `app`: the app which is requested to retrieve contents 
  (eg. `gitlab`)
* `content_type`: the type of contents we want to retrieve from this app 
  (eg. `issue`, `activity`, `commit`, `merge requests`‚Ä¶)
* `channel`: some apps can be requested to get a more or less filtered contents. 
  For exemple, in Gitlab, it's called "scope". You can retrieve issues from:
  * the whole site (`channel=None` and `channel_obj=None` for us)
  * a specific group (`channel="group"` and `channel_obj="<gitlab_group_id>"`)
  * a specific project (`channel="project"` and `channel_obj="<gitlab_project_id>"`)
  * a specific author (`channel="author"` and `channel_obj="<gitlab_user_id>"`)
  * a specific assignee (`channel="assignee"` and `channel_obj="<gitlab_user_id>"`)
  * etc.
* `channel_obj`: the ID (for the app requested) of the channel's related object

Before you ask: yes, some contents can be duplicated (eg. an issue from the "group" channel 
could be duplicated in the "project" channel). It's normal and **wanted**. Remember : the purpose
of this app is to retrieve and display the `last N contents of something`. If the issue we are 
talking about is in the `last N issues of project "cybermen"`, it does not mean it's also in 
`the last N issues of group "dr-who-best-friends"`. To manage different timelines for each channel,
and keep a KISS Model, we need those duplicates.


## Installation

You **MUST** use a DB supporting 
django's [`JSONField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/3.2/ref/models/fields/#jsonfield)

You **SHOULD NOT** install this app but you **SHOULD** install one (or more) of it's children 
(see [external sources supported](#External-sources-supported)). eg:

`pip install dalec-gitlab dalec-nextcloud`

Then, add `dalec`, `dalec_prime` and dalek's children to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ‚Ä¶
    "dalec",
    "dalec_prime",  # if you want to use your own Content model, does not add it
    "dalec_gitlab",
    "dalec_nextcloud",
    # ‚Ä¶
]
```

## Usage

Add `dalec/main.js` inside templates where you need to use the dalec. 

Each dalec's child app will probably need some specific configuration to retrieve external contents 
(eg: token or login/password). Please refer to this dalec's child app configuration section first.

Now your dalec's child app is configured, you can display it's X last contents somewhere in a 
template by using the templatag `dalec`:

```django
{% load dalec %}

{% dalec app content_type [template=None] [channel=None] [channel_object=None] [**channelKwargs] %}

real exemples:

Retrieves last gitlab issues for a specific user:
{% dalec "gitlab" "issue" channel="user" channel_object="doctor-who" %}

Retrieves recent gitlab activity for a group:
{% dalec "gitlab" "activity" channel="group" channel_object='companions' %}

Retrieves recent gitlab activity for a project:
{% dalec "gitlab" "activity" channel="project" channel_object='tardis' %}

Retrieves recent gitlab issues for a project:
{% dalec "gitlab" "issue" channel="project" channel_object='tardis' %}

Retrieves recent gitlab issues for a project and give the channel_object to register:
{% dalec "gitlab" "issue" channel="project" channel_object='tardis' dj_channel_obj=tardis_obj %}
```

## Configuration

This app have general settings which can be erased for all of it's children and sometimes by 
content type.

* General setting format : `DALEC_SOMETHING`
* overided child version (it's app name, like gitlab for exemple): `DALEC_GITLAB_SOMETHING`
* overided content type version (gitlab's issues for exemple): `DALEC_GITLAB_ISSUE_SOMETHING`

### DALEC_NB_CONTENTS_KEPT

* * *default*: `10`
* per child app setting: yes
* per child app's content type setting: yes

Set the number of contents to keep by type. Oldest will be purged to keep only the last X contents 
of each channel and type.
`0` means "no limit".

### DALEC_AJAX_REFRESH

* *default*: `True`
* per child app setting: yes
* per child app's content type setting: yes

If `True`, when an user display a channel contents, an ajax requests is sent to refresh content. 
It's usefull if you do not want to use a cron task and/or need to get always the last contents.

### DALEC_TTL

* *default*: `900`
* per child app setting: yes
* per child app's content type setting: yes

Number of seconds before an ajax request sends a new query to the instance providing instance.

### DALEC_CONTENT_MODEL

* *default*: `"dalec_prime.Content"`
* per child app setting: no
* per child app's content type setting: no

Concrete model to use to store contents. If you do not want to use the default one,
you should not add `dalec.prime` in `INSTALLED_APPS` to avoid to load a useless model
and have an empty table in your data base.

### DALEC_FETCH_HISTORY_MODEL

* *default*: `"dalec_prime.FetchHistory"`
* per child app setting: no
* per child app's content type setting: no

Same as `DALEC_CONTENT_MODEL` but for the `FetchHistory` model.

### DALEC_CSS_FRAMEWORK

* *default*: `None`
* per child app setting: yes
* per child app's content type setting: no

Name of the (S)CSS framework you use on your website. It changes the default templates used to 
display contents. Templates are priorized in this order (`css_framework` versions only used if 
you set a value to `DALEC_CSS_FRAMEWORK`):

* `dalec/%(app)s/%(tpl)s-list.html`: only if you use a specific template, see templatags `dalec`
* `dalec/%(app)s/%(css_framework)s/%(content_type)s-%(channel)s-list.html`
* `dalec/%(app)s/%(content_type)s-%(channel)s-list.html`
* `dalec/%(app)s/%(css_framework)s/%(content_type)s-list.html`
* `dalec/%(app)s/%(content_type)s-list.html`
* `dalec/%(app)s/%(css_framework)s/list.html`
* `dalec/%(app)s/list.html`
* `dalec/default/%(css_framework)s/list.html`
* `dalec/default/list.html` 

Supported valued are:

* `None`: only dalec classes and data will be added. HTML elements are sementics. Templates are the default ones.

Future supported values could be:

* materialize
* bulma
* bootstrap
* semantic-ui

## Customization

### Styles

No styles are included inside dalec who must remains pure with no feelings. 
But some SCSS framework may be supported. Please refer to `DALEC_CSS_FRAMEWORK` setting.

### Templates

You should always inherit from the default templates and use defined blocks to customise it.

#### List

Each app can have it's own "list" template but if it doesn't, a default one will be used. 
In priority order:

* `dalec/<childappname>/<contenttype>-<channel>-list.html`
* `dalec/<childappname>/<contenttype>-list.html`
* `dalec/<childappname>/list.html`
* `dalec/default/list.html`

#### Item

Each content types can have it's own template. Those filenames will be tried:

* `dalec/<childappname>/<contenttype>-<channel>-item.html`
* `dalec/<childappname>/<contenttype>-item.html`
* `dalec/<childappname>/item.html`
* `dalec/default/item.html`

For "gitlab" app, "issue" content type and "project" channel we will try :

* `dalec/gitlab/issue-project-item.html`
* `dalec/gitlab/issue-item.html`
* `dalec/gitlab/item.html`
* `dalec/default/item.html`

### Models

Model used to store contents is defined by the setting `DALEC_CONTENT_MODEL` which has the
default value `"dalec_prime.Content"`.
If you want to use your own model, in your `settings.py`:

* remove `dalec.prime` from `INSTALLED_APPS`
* set the setting `DALEC_CONTENT_MODEL` with `<yourapp>.<yourModel>`

## External sources supported

* ü¶ù [https://dev.webu.coop/w/i/dalec-nextcloud/](dalec-gitlab):
  get issues and activities from a gitlab instance

## External sources which could be nice to support

* üåç dalec-wikimedia: get last pages from a wikimedia instance
* üìÖ dalec-caldav: get events and tasks from a caldav instance (eg: nextcloud agenda)

## Manage a new external source

If you want to add a specific external source, you just have to extends `dalec.proxy.Proxy`
and override it's `_fetch` method.

To create a dalec child (a proper way), you should create a new django app with the name pattern
`dalec_<yourExternalSourceUname>`
